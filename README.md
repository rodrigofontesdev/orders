# Orders

A food delivery app designed for small restaurants and food shops. The customer can choose from a menu, select what they want, and send the order to the restaurant via WhatsApp. The restaurant receives a notification with the complete order including the selected products, quantity, and total price.

My purpose with this app was learn how to build a mobile app from scratch. This is my first experience with programming focused on apps.
